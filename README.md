# OsuBuddy-reversed
osu!STD A-I-O Cheat<br>Thank you, kat. for the *reversed* files.

# What is OsuBuddy?
OsuBuddy is an all in one cheat for osu!Standard, it's **UNDETECTABLE** if used properly.

# OsuBuddy Features
- **Aim Assist**: Will assist your mouse towards the next note!
- **Relax**: Will automatically click the notes for you!
- **Replay Player**: Will playback the selected replay, can also interpolate and flip replays. Also has the option to only play mouse and/or keyboard inputs

# Why is OsuBuddy undetectable?
If used properly, OsuBuddy is 100% Undetectable.<br>
That being said, if you use this program with horrible settings, you will get banned.<br>
Peppy's main source of cheat detection (at the moment) is detecting for injected files and DLL's, to see if any of osu's files have been read/modified.<br>
OsuBuddy is fully external. It doesn't read or write memory, giving peppy no way of detecting it this way.

# How to use OsuBuddy
Make sure you have osu! opened<br>
Then run the packaged OsuBuddy.exe file<br>
Select the module's / settings you'd like enabled<br>
Then play a map and enjoy!

# Disclaimer
These files are old version of OsuBuddy (Themida version) and I only clean it to make it compilable, this was already pre-cracked by kat. Files might contains left-over/unused code.
